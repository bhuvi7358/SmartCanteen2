Project Title: Smart Canteen Management System

Description: The Smart Canteen Management System is a digital platform designed to streamline food ordering, payment, and delivery processes within an institutional or corporate canteen. The system aims to eliminate long queues, reduce manual errors, and provide a faster, more convenient dining experience for users.

It is developed using Android Studio (Java/XML) for the frontend and Firebase as the backend database, ensuring real-time updates and secure data handling. Users can browse the menu, place orders, make cashless payments, and track order status directly through the mobile application.

The system has two primary modules:

Customer Module:

User registration and login (with Firebase Authentication).

View available menu items with default images and prices.

Add items to the cart, customize orders, and place requests in real-time.

Place the Order and cash on delivery.

Receive order confirmation and estimated preparation time.

Admin/Canteen Staff Module:

Add, update, or remove food items from the menu.

Receive and manage incoming orders with status tracking (Pending, Preparing, Ready, Delivered).

Key Features:

Real-time Menu Updates: Instant synchronization of menu changes with all users.

Order Tracking: Customers can see order status updates without visiting the counter.

Reduced Wait Times: Pre-ordering ensures minimal crowding during peak hours.

Data Analytics: Admin can view daily, weekly, or monthly sales data to optimize operations.

Technology Stack:

Frontend: Android Studio (Java/XML)

Backend: Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage

Payment Integration: UPI/Payment Gateway API

SMS Manager for order notifications
